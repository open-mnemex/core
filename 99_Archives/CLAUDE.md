# Archives (冷藏库)

Completed projects and inactive areas.
Files here are preserved but no longer actively worked on.

---

## What Goes Here

- **Completed projects** from `10_Projects/` (finished, cancelled, or stale)
- **Inactive areas** from `20_Areas/` (skills you no longer maintain)
- **Legacy data** in `Legacy_Pre2025/` (pre-system bulk imports)

## The 3R Protocol (完结项目流程)

Before archiving, execute three steps:

1. **Refine (提炼):** Extract reusable tools → `30_Resources/`,
   extract immutable facts → `00_Vault/`.
2. **Reduce (减负):** Delete noise (`node_modules`, temp files,
   intermediate builds). Convert key files to long-lived formats
   (PDF/A, CSV, Markdown).
3. **Record (记录):** Write a context capsule in `README.md` —
   final status, key file locations, unresolved items, environment.

Full methodology:

## Legacy_Pre2025/

Bulk storage of old, unsorted folders imported before the Digital Life
System was established.
These are kept for reference but not individually organized.

---

## Retrieval

If you need to revive an archived project:
1. Copy (do not move) to `10_Projects/`
2. Update `00_PLAN.md` with new status and date
3. Add to active projects table in root `CLAUDE.md`
