# Areas (能力与系统)

**Definition:** Your capabilities and systems. Living documents you actively maintain.
These represent "what you know" and "what you can do" — core to your identity.

## 20_Areas Philosophy

1.  **Ownership:** Every folder here represents a skill you possess or a system you run.
2.  **Maintenance:** These are NOT static archives. They evolve as your skills improve.
3.  **Structure:** Each Area should have its own `CLAUDE.md` if it has specific automation or context rules.

## Guidelines

-   **Scripts:** Place automation scripts in `macOS_Automation/Scripts/` if they are general purpose.
-   **Configs:** Service-specific configs go into `Home_Lab_Config/` or the specific Area.
-   **Documentation:** Always maintain a `README.md` in the root of each Area.
