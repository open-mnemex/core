## [Topic]

> [Original text, English preferred, line width <= 80 chars]
>
> —— **[Author]**, [Title/Credentials]
>
> Source: [Link](URL) (Date)

**中文概括：** [Summary if content was in Chinese]
```

## Rules

- **English first:** Always search for the original English source
- **Attribution:** Full name + title/credentials
- **Source required:** Link to where you found it
- **Line width:** <= 80 chars within blockquote
- **中文概括:** Only add when the quote is single-language.
  If the quote already contains both Chinese and English
  (bilingual), skip 中文概括 — it would be redundant.
